# Wallpaper-Grabber
A python script that grabs images from Unsplash and sets it as wallpaper for your Windows or Linux Machines

## Requirements:
requests library
```
pip3 install requests
```

## Usage:
```
python3 run.py
```

Tested this on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Gnome desktop and Windows 7, I have no idea whether it works or not in Windows 10. I also don't know whether it works on other desktop managers for linux.
If you know how to set wallpaper on other Linux Distros, feel free to create a Pull Request.
