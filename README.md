# Wallpaper-Grabber
A python script that grabs images from Unsplash and sets it as wallpaper for your Windows or Linux Machines

Tested this on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS Gnome desktop and it worked fine. I don't know whether it works on other desktop managers.
If you know how to set wallpaper on other Linux Distros, feel free to create a Pull Request.
